# Hello-World
Hello World, part of my course cuuriculum for SDEV at Ivy Tech

I am a triplet, and my brothers are really great guys. My younger brother studies art and has some amazing drawings and paintings. My older brother cannot physically attend classes or mentally do so either, but he is a lovable guy.
